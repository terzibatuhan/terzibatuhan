This repository showcases my work in AI programming, emphasizing clean, maintainable, and optimized code. I focus on:

* Consistent and well-defined variable names to ensure clarity and reduce confusion.
* Readability by structuring files appropriately using namespaces, and following correct public/private function practices.
* Abstractions, inheritance, and interfaces to create scalable and flexible systems.
* Architectural patterns that guide problem-solving and keep code organized.
* Tests to ensure functionality and maintain quality throughout development.

These principles reflect my approach to creating professional, efficient, and high-quality code. Feel free to contact me at terzibatuhan1@gmail.com for any inquiries or potential collaborations.
